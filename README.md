# ML Algorithms from Scratch

This repository contains implementations of various Machine Learning (ML) algorithms developed from scratch using Python. The aim is to provide a deeper understanding of how these algorithms work under the hood by building them without relying on high-level libraries.


## Algorithms Implemented
- Linear Regression
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- NaiveBayesClassifier


Note: This repository is a work in progress. More algorithms and features will be added over time. In addition, many of the existing files may be changed to improve performance, readability or both!
